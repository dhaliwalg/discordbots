A list of the bots I've made! Alongside their authentication links, in case you want to add them to your server!
1. Clippy/RockPaperScissors (rps_bot.py):
       This is a variety bot that does a few things. It can print a random quote from the TV sitcom Brooklyn 99, flip a fair coin, roll dice (you enter number of dice          and the number of sides), or you play rock paper scissors with it (you enter your move with the command)! Discord requires secret tokens for the bot to work, so
       in order for it to run you'll need to get your own API key and fill in DISCORD_TOKEN in the code. See tutorial, https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/#how-to-make-a-discord-bot-in-the-developer-portal, and use my code.
       
       How to run it (cause it's not hosted):
       Download the rps_bot.py file somewhere onto your computer.
       Fill in DISCORD_TOKEN with your own acquired token. (ignore the GUILD and DISCORD_GUILD)
       Do "python rps_bot.py". Terminal should say bot has connected to discord.
       Go nuts!
