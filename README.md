A list of the bots I've made! Alongside their authentication links, in case you want to add them to your server!
1. Clippy/RockPaperScissors (rps_bot.py):
       This is a variety bot that does a few things. It can print a random quote from the TV sitcom Brooklyn 99, flip a fair coin, roll dice (you enter number of dice          and the number of sides), or you play rock paper scissors with it (you enter your move with the command)! I tried to change the name to Clippy after I added other        functionality rather than only rock paper scissors, but the Discord API made it kinda difficult to change the name. Authentication link to add it to a                    server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=875194027329331280&permissions=0&scope=bot
       
       How to run it (cause it's not hosted):
       Download the rps_bot.py file somewhere onto your computer.
       Do "python rps_bot.py". Terminal should say bot has connected to discord.
       Go nuts!
